<p begin="00:00:02.480" end="00:00:07.759" style="s2">today i&#39;m going to talk about the top</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.640" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">five programming myths that stop people</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.759" end="00:00:12.080" style="s2">from learning how to program and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:14.320" style="s2">make junior developers feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.080" end="00:00:15.839" style="s2">are not good enough i used to believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.320" end="00:00:18.160" style="s2">all these myths before and it really</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.839" end="00:00:19.760" style="s2">slowed my progress</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.160" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:23.840" style="s2">everybody can learn to program</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">this one it&#39;s a lie</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.840" end="00:00:28.000" style="s2">this one is a lie that many companies</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:30.560" style="s2">tell you because they want to sell you</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:32.719" style="s2">courses and books and bootcamps and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.560" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">videos and it&#39;s not true people keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.719" end="00:00:36.399" style="s2">saying that everybody can program</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">because programming is easy and fun and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.399" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">that anybody can do it when it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">true not everybody can do that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be enjoyable for</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:47.200" style="s2">everybody and it&#39;s not going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">career path for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.200" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">as a teacher i can honestly tell you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">that there are some people that are just</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">not good or they&#39;re just not made for</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">programming just like i am not made to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:01:00.079" style="s2">dance ballet</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:01.359" style="s2">some people are just different and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.359" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">saying that everybody can be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">programmer is like saying that anybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">can be a painter now we can all take</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">paint and put it on the canvas but that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:14.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that we are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">good at mixing colors or proportions or</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.960" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">our shadows and most of us are not going</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">to enjoy painting i hate</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:23.360" style="s2">painting you need to enjoy logical</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:26.560" style="s2">thinking and problem solving and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">you need to be okay with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.560" end="00:01:32.799" style="s2">most of the time spent programming is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">frustrating is lonely not socializing in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.799" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">front of a computer feeling like you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:41.720" style="s2">an idiot because your code doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:41.720" style="s2">at 3am in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">this is why if you ask programmers if</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">they really enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">programming per se they will say no</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">programming per se it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">frustrating boring annoying whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">want to call it but what you will see is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">that programmers enjoy programming</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">because of the result because of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">happens when you finish what happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">when you push through that frustration</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">and your code is finally there</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">programming is not for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">programming can be painful can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">frustrating everybody should know this</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">but also it&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">number two programming is memorization</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">beginners approach programming the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">way that they approach studying for an</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">exam in college where it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">remembering but not understanding this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">is especially true in korea where</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">everything is focused on the result on</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">the exam rather than on the process</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">programming is the opposite first you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">need to understand the concepts and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">you get to remember them it is not about</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">memorization whatsoever to make a great</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">piece of software you do not need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">remember all the keywords on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">programming language or whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">using you need to logically understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">the problem that you need to solve and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">what tools you have available so then</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">you can make use of the tools to fix it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">most programmers do not remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">anything most programmers google at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">times senior programmers are not seniors</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">because they remember everything i never</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">use google senior programmers code less</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">and make more money than juniors because</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">they just have a better view and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">understanding of all the systems and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">the landscapes of the software</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">development world if you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">good programmer don&#39;t try to memorize</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">try to gain understanding first</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">number three is you gotta be a genius to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">be a programmer</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">this one is a big one because of what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">see on the movies most of the time is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">some like kind of wizard kit that is on</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">the screen typing really fast never</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">making any mistakes and just hacking</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">into the white house in the united</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">states now this is not what a good</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">programmer is or what a good hacker even</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">is this meet is the one that hits</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">hardest for junior programmers that feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">like they are not good enough they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">feel ready to ask for a job so they keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">studying and studying and studying and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">studying and this especially happens in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">korea where everyone wants to be at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">top and being at the middle is not good</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">enough and actually you don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">a genius to program they&#39;re just okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">programmers they are the average they</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">are good enough decent good enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">okay programmer is what most of us are</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be a genius programmer</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">to be able to get a job to start your</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">own company you can just be good enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">and that is okay in the programming</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">number four is programmers are talented</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">if you know how to program is because</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">you have a talent that god gave you or</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">something now i&#39;m a firm believer that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">discipline beats</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">talent</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">sure maybe there are some people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.720" style="s2">are better at computers there are some</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">people that maybe will understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">something like distributed cloud</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">database systems faster if i explain to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">them but programming is not a game of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">talent programming is a game of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">persistence</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">programming is basically saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to go to sleep until i fix</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">this function i am going to find this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">bug i&#39;m not gonna get angry and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">going to read and do everything again</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">what it takes to be a programmer is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">talent what takes to be a programmer is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">not giving up programming is a constant</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">fight with the machine</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">that&#39;s how you win you win by not giving</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">up you don&#39;t win with talent</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">if you have focus if you are disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">if you are patient</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">you are going to be a better programmer</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">that somebody else that has a talent but</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">cannot focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">number five you need to be good at math</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">the reason why i put this one here is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">because many people make it look like</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">math and being good at math is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">requirement to learn to program and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">is not true</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">now it&#39;s not a requirement but</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">it helps if you don&#39;t like math can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">still learn to program yes what can you</p>

<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">which programming language should i</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">start with</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">now this question is very hard to answer</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">correctly the reason why is because when</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">you ask me that question i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">you i don&#39;t know what you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what you want to build so</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">if i tell you oh just learn</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">python html css i will be robbing you of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">an explanation that you deserve in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">background that you need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">i&#39;m going to answer you with giving you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">five programming languages the more</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">popular ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">why are they used if you learn them</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">where are you gonna get where are you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">the first one we start with is c and c</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">plus plus c is a programming language</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">designed for a very very low level</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">performance very very very very close to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">the machine</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">so for example you can use c to program</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">aircons or smart tvs or smart fridges</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.399" style="s2">stuff like that something that has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">little bit of yes programming but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.399" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have lots of memory also if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">learn cnc plus plus</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">most likely you&#39;re also going to find a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">job in those big companies or</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">enterprises that have a make softwares</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">that require performance for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">you&#39;re going to end up working a project</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">like photoshop or premiere pro like in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">company like adobe that you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">software that really needs performance</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">next programming language java java is</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">very popular in korea and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">time java is very popular in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">corporations government banks and all</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">that stuff nowadays is used to build</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">enterprise web applications if you learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">java you&#39;re 100 gonna get a job there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:29.680" style="s2">many many jobs for java they are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">most of the time in very fast moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.680" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">startups java is usually used by</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">enterprise as a set or when you need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">integrate with older legacy systems so</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">some banks are in java most governments</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">are in java company that integrates with</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">this kind of services then you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">to need java also if you learn java you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">are going to be able to program android</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">applications so if you want to be like</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">an enterprise developer do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">you have a job and to have a safe job in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">an environment that doesn&#39;t move as fast</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">as for example front-end development</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:05.279" style="s2">then java is for you also if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">a android developer 100 and you love</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">android then java is the place for you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">next one python i think the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">choice for a beginner and the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">i say this is because python is very</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">very very very multi-purpose for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">in python you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">find how to hack computers which is how</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">i learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">also with python you can do machine</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">learning also with python you can do</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">data science also in python you can do</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">data visualization also with python you</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">scraping the internet also you can build</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">websites there&#39;s many as you can see you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">can do many many many things a beginner</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">friendly language is not as ugly as java</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:51.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s not as ugly as c</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">you need to remember that the closer the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">language is to the system the lower</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">level the more ugly it is python is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">very pretty language to read and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">why beginners like it so much because it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t scare you at the beginning like</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">c if you see c</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">oh my god what that okay javascript but</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">let&#39;s make one programming language</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">let&#39;s call it html css and javascript if</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">you want to build websites and that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">the main focus of what you want to learn</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">to program then go for html css and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">javascript that is how you start making</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:26.399" style="s2">websites some people will tell you oh if</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">you want to make a website then go for</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">python because python makes websites as</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">well yes you can make a website with</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">python the difference is that with html</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">css and javascript you learn</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">by building something that is visually</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">attractive for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">and also you learn how the web works</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">from the from nothing to everything so</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">when you want to become a web developer</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">and if that&#39;s what you want to do then</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">html css and javascript now also if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">learn javascript and you like it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be able to build very to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">build many dynamic websites you can also</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.959" style="s2">make some ios android applications you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">can also program the back-end now</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.959" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">javascript is also kind of multi-purpose</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">like python is but javascript is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">old and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">php is to build backends you can build</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">backends with php and php runs</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">most of the internet runs on php why</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:28.720" style="s2">because there is this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">wordpress wordpress runs with php and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">many websites use wordpress for many</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">many many things</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.279" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">also php is uh stable the community is</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t usually use it that much i</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">learned it before but for me it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not my thing i prefer python or</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">node.js but also if you learn php and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">you want to be able to do stuff for</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">wordpress if you want to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">stuff for things like magento</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">or drupal stuff like that like content</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">management systems then php is your guy</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">all right my people that&#39;s it so now</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s your turn ask yourself the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">what do you want to build</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">choose right start with why first know</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">yourself and then all the answers will</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">be in front of you thank you for</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">process that i follow when i&#39;m learning</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">a new programming language and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">because nowadays i&#39;m very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">go and many people have been asking me</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">how did i learn go did i take a course</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">did i watch a video did i read a book</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">what did i do so that&#39;s what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">talk about on this video and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">process that i&#39;m going to describe has</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">helped me learn many languages and many</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">frameworks over the years so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">i want to share that with you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">now first we need to answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">why should you as a developer that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">already have a job as developer how</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">should why should you learn a new</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">language what&#39;s the point well if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">are a developer let&#39;s say you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">python developer</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">and you learn a new language what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">going to happen is that your python code</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.440" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">is going to improve for example when i</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">was writing javascript most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">and then i went to learn haskell and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">came back from learning haskell</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">my javascript code was so much better</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">because of that because learning haskell</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">i learned new ways of doing things i</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">learned new philosophies i learned how</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">to structure the code in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">because of the haskell rules and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">when i brought that into javascript my</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">code was way better because of that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">when you learn any new programming</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">language any new technology those things</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">have new philosophies new patterns new</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">structures new whatever and that helps</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">you when you bring those concepts back</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">to your main programming language so if</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">you&#39;re a python developer and you go and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">learn rust you might find something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">you like from rust and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">bring into python and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">you will become just a better developer</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">overall</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">so the first thing i do when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">learning a new language is i go to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">documentation on the documentation i</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">find out why did they create the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">language what is the philosophy of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">language what is the best use case who</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">is using the language and also the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">community the creators all that is there</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">so i go immediately to the documentation</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">then i try to understand and remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.480" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">the syntax of the language so i need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">find out if the language has parentheses</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">or square brackets or curly braces comma</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">no comma all that i get that done as</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">fast as i can</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">then what i do is i try to find</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">equivalences equivalences taking</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">knowledge that you already know on your</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">main language and trying to take that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">into your new language so for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">this is how you make a function on</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">python how do you make a function on go</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">i try to find that out</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">this is a variable on python how do i</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">make a variable in go this is how you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">make a conditional in python how do i</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">make a conditional angle i try to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">these associations these analogies</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:21.839" style="s2">because the brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">works so much better when learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.839" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">something that is related to what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">already know once i&#39;m done with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">equivalences function function variable</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">variable object object</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">once i have that in my brain i</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">immediately go and start writing code</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">the most important thing is that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">need to write code as fast as possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">don&#39;t waste time looking at tutorials</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:46.079" style="s2">don&#39;t waste time reading more about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">language write code now what code do i</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.079" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">write i don&#39;t write amazing things at</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">the beginning i just write the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">equivalences i create a variable on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">language i create a function on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">language i create a conditional a loop</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">all that on the language so i&#39;m familiar</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">with writing on the new syntax</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">once i&#39;m done writing all those old</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">concepts in a new language what i do is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">i go for tutorials the thing with</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:13.600" style="s2">tutorials is i felt like i was just</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">copying code from the songs i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.600" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">feel like i learned anything i just felt</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">like i was just copy pasting code so now</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">what i do instead is that i take on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">tutorial or open source project or</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">break it down and then put it back</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">together that&#39;s what i do now i remove</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">one part remove another part and just</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">break it down understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">happened and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">i tried to put it in together again</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">these kind of things help me understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">more because now it feels like the code</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">is mine because it feels like i can take</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">it apart and i can put it back in</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">together and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">once i&#39;m done breaking and fixing other</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">people&#39;s code</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">what i do is i start writing my own code</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">i start creating my own project and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">is when beginners have a problem and is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">that they start with projects then they</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">have never built before so they say okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">i&#39;m learning go i want to make a chatbot</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">and then you tell okay have you made a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">chatbot before no</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s a problem when you want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">make a project on a new programming</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">language and also you have never made</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">that project before you have to find out</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">two things first you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">how to make the project logically</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">and then you have to write that down on</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">a new programming language and that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">an impossible task</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">what i do instead is that i</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:32.640" style="s2">take projects that i already built</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">and i turn them</p>

<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">the logic will be the same and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">allows me to focus on learning the new</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">today we are going to talk about why</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">java is named java why ruby is named</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">ruby one python is named python</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">let&#39;s get started with java java was</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">first going to be called oak like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">tree because that tree was growing</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">outside of the offices of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">designers of java the problem was that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.080" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t name it oak because it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">already trademarked there was already a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">company with that name so the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">came back to the team and they told them</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">to come up with a new name he up</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">and what the team was is that they went</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">into a room and they started to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">brainstorming of some names and some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">the options that they got were for</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">example dna or silk or wrl which means</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">web runner language and thankfully they</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">arrived to the name jab</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">java is also a kind of coffee and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">also an island on indonesia so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">why you see that the logo of java is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">like a hot cup of coffee</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">then we got a programming language</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">called kotlin</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">kotlin is directly inspired by java and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">is actually like an improvement of java</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">kotlin is made by a company called jet</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:17.440" style="s2">brains that company is a russian company</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">and because java is also an island on</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.440" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">indonesia</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:23.490" style="s2">jetbrains named their programming</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">language after a russian island</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.490" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">then we have javascript javascript was</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">first called mocha like the coffee plus</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">chocolate preparation but then they</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">switched from mocha to live script and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">at that point in time java was super</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">super popular so what they wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">was like a marketing trick and they</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">changed the name livescript to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">javascript hoping that people thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2">that javascript was going to complement</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">java and they just wanted developers to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">basically be interested in javascript</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">and it looks like it worked because now</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">javascript is one of the most popular</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">c was named after a programming language</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">called b because many of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">b had c got influenced by then we got c</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">plus plus on the programming word plus</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">plus means increment so basically is</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">like an increment of c so c plus plus</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">means like c plus one and then we got c</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">sharp on the music word when you play a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">note and you put the sharp that also</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:28.640" style="s2">means an increment on the note it should</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">be played a tone higher so on the music</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.640" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">word sharp is an increment on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">programming word plus plus is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:41.159" style="s2">increment and if you look at it c sharp</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:41.159" style="s2">is basically c with four plus plus plus</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">ruby is a programming language created</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">by an ilbon saram and this programming</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">language was directly inspired by pearl</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">pearl is like a precious stone and is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:55.919" style="s2">also another programming language so</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">what the creator of ruby wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.919" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">was also name his language like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">precious stone so he chose ruby</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">python was named after a comedy show</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">called monty python people think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">python was named after a snake because</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">the creator of python loves snakes is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:13.919" style="s2">not true the creator of python loved a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">comedy show called monty python</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.919" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">and now if you&#39;re wondering go was</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">created by google so that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">the go part the name of the mascot of go</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">is and he is an animal called gopper</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">and rust was also named after a fungus</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">because the designer of ross kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">liked those sort of organisms so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">why he made it nothing much on that name</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">not much story behind it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s it for this video thank you so</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">the same c on the name so sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">can get confused so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">c c is a language that was created 47</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">years ago it&#39;s a very long time ago c</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">has influenced languages such as java</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">javascript python</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">go among many others so is is seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">very important language in the history</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">of computer programming c was created as</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">i said 47 years ago that means that back</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">then the computers weren&#39;t so fast as</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">they are right now so c is very good</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">working on machines that don&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">million lines of sea code that is just</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">raw c code because the mass rover that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">little tiny robot not little but that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">robot doesn&#39;t have a lot of memory</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a lot of processing power</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">so we need as much speed as we can in as</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">little space as possible that is c now</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">what is c plus plus c plus plus is just</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">like c</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">but with classes and even the creator of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">c plus plus says that c</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">is obsolete when he created c plus plus</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">he intended c plus plus to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">superset of c a superset is a language</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">that extends another language so for</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">example javascript and typescript</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">typescript extends javascript because it</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">adds</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">types</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">javascript doesn&#39;t have types typescript</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">is just like javascript but it has a new</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:03.760" style="s2">addition an extension</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">because it has types</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.760" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">c plus plus and c</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">was supposed to be seen as a c</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">with classes because c does not support</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">classes object-oriented programming that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">is very very important when you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">organizing large code bases this is what</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">the creator of c plus plus says the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">creator of c plus plus says that he</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">intended c plus plus to be the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">replacement of c and that they should</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">have been used one language all together</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">unification because they are so similar</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">except that the the c plus plus has</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">classes among all the details now what</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">is program on c plus plus i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">that there is a difference in speed</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">whatsoever and there is not a difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">in how close you can be on the hardware</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">but people sometimes choose c plus plus</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">because they enjoy the object oriented</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">programming now c sharp c sharp is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">whole different beast c sharp is more</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">similar to java than it is to c plus c</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:58.080" style="s2">sharp is like</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">the java of microsoft it&#39;s a programming</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">language that was created for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">enterprise applications microsoft spent</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">thousands of dollars and hours making</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">this language because c-sharp works on</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:15.440" style="s2">the net ecosystem java and oracle</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">does one thing c-sharp.net</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.440" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing there&#39;s like two</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">teams for the corporate and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">enterprise in korea i&#39;ve seen that java</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">rules the most but outside of korea</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">mostly in the us and in europe c-sharp</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">and net they roll the most also c-sharp</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">is very powerful you can make back-ends</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">you can make front-ends you can make ios</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">applications and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">nowadays c-sharp has seen a very high</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">increase in usage because of unity 3d in</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">c-sharp if you if you learn c-sharp you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">can make</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">video games for xbox playstation uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">computer ios android and even web</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">with unity 3d unity3d is a video game</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">engine so the thing is that c sharp is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">not as fast as c plus plus because on c</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">sharp</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t do stuff manually the compiler</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">and the program help us doing some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">on c plus plus and on c we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">things manually because c is more of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">lower level language so people say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">on c plus plus the computer runs fast</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">and on c sharp the developer runs fast i</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:23.840" style="s2">think c sharp is a language where many</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:26.399" style="s2">developers are very satisfied with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">because it just has a lot of developer</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">speed you can do lots of stuff and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do things manually as with</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">c plus plus c sharp is more similar to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">java so for example if you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">javascript typescript or java you can go</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">into c sharp really really quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">it will take you maybe one or two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">to get ready and go for it i might in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:48.640" style="s2">case i program on c sharp because i like</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">to make stuff in unity 3d so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.640" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">i use sharp i never work with microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">any kind of microsoft enterprise but</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very good career</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">choice to learn c sharp if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">work with the enterprise and the net</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">ecosystem all right so that&#39;s it very</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">small systems speed speed speed c-sharp</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:10.640" style="s2">is more of an enterprise thing c-sharp</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">looks like looks more like java than it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">looks like c and it&#39;s enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">developer speed on c sharp is higher</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">computer speed on c and c plus plus is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">higher so there are different beasts for</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">different things most companies use c</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">sharp or java and then when they need</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">actual speed they go to first year c</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:28.880" style="s2">plus</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">thank you for watching let me know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.880" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">you think of this video i really really</p>

<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">kimchi bye bye</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.159" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">on this video i&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">why python is such a popular programming</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">language what are the best three uses of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">python and how you can start learning it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">this year python passed java on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">stack overflow developers survey as the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">most popular programming language last</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">year it passed c-sharp and the year</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">before that it passed php python has</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">been growing exponentially and really</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">fast these last maybe four to five years</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">but why python is not popular only</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">because of one reason python is popular</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">because of a combination of many reasons</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">the first one is that python code looks</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">almost like english code</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">is very close to the human language even</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know any computer science</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:35.840" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t know how to program</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">but you read some python code you will</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">chances are be able to understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">going on because it really looks like</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">almost like just human normal language</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that developers</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">that are starting love and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">something that developers that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">experienced also love another reason why</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">it&#39;s so popular is because python keeps</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">your options open it doesn&#39;t put you on</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">any box for example if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">what you want to do maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">try web development maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">try ai maybe you want to try data</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">science but you don&#39;t know maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">want to do some security and hacking and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">all that python is the perfect language</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">for a person like that because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:18.159" style="s2">have to go into a box of back-end</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">developer ai developer machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.159" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">developer you do not have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">because if you&#39;re in python you can move</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">between all those disciplines as much as</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">you want without having to learn a new</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">language so if you&#39;re having a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">choosing which area of technology you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">want to work learning python is just</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">going to be the perfect choice because</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:39.039" style="s2">it will allow you to just try a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">bit see if you like it and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">move on without learning another</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">programming language and that brings me</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:48.559" style="s2">to my reason number three the community</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">in python is unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.559" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">awesome is very big and very diverse</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">because we have people from everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">on the industry we have people that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">machine learning engineers we have web</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">developers we have hackers we have data</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">scientists we have mathematicians we</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">have finance we have so many people on</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">this community and they are all coming</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">with their own tools with their own open</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">source so there are more tutorials there</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">are more courses there are more videos</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">there are more questions there are more</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">answers and it&#39;s just when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">starting as a beginner seeing such huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">community will help you a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">python you can do almost anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s a multi-purpose programming</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">language but the three things where</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">python is used the most is on web</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">ai machine learning and data science</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">and scripting so web development with</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">python you can make a backend for an</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">application you can make an api you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">you can make a whole website using</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">python uh for example instagram uses</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">python pinterest uses python reddit uses</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">python on their backend the second one</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">is machine learning many people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">making amazing libraries for machine</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">learning such as for example google is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">giving us tensorflow we also have cadas</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">we also have panda we have so many</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.880" style="s2">libraries for machine learning that if</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">you want to get into machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.880" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">that is the way python is really really</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">used by the industry into trained models</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">supervised learning unsupervised</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">learning all that it&#39;s on python now the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">third use</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">of python is scripting and scripting</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">basically means</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">automating the boring stuff for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">if you&#39;re an office worker and you need</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:32.799" style="s2">to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">change the name of 1000 pdfs you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">make a simple python script that will do</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">that in one second whether you will take</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">maybe 30 minutes or an hour doing it</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">scripting allows you to just use python</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">for small tasks that you might you might</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">face on your workplace so for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:51.919" style="s2">scripting can be something that people</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">like accountants lawyers students</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.919" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">anybody can learn how to descript them</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">with python because it will just improve</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">their life they don&#39;t have to become a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">developer they don&#39;t have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">programmer but they can just learn a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">little bit so they can automate the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">boring office work stuff and this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:08.879" style="s2">something where python shines a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">having said that how can you start</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.879" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">learning python well on this video we</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">are launching a free python course for</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">absolute beginners where we are doing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">do some of this optimization of boring</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">work in the case of the course that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">just uploaded we are going to go to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">websites that offer jobs and we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.480" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">going to take those jobs and we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">going to put them on an excel sheet for</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">more organization it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">simple project where you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">learn how to extract data from different</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">websites and how to put them all inside</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">of an excel</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">thank you for watching let me know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">you think of this video i hope that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">go and take our free course it&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">free free as always don&#39;t forget to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">happy don&#39;t forget to eat kimchi and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">that&#39;s it thank you bye-bye</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">today we&#39;re going to learn why a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">programming language like python is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">slower</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">than a programming language like c by by</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">the way i said slower i didn&#39;t say slow</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">slower all programming languages are</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">very fast okay they do things fast in</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">our computer faster than our brains can</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">do it so they&#39;re all fast some of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">are slow work doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re slow</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:26.060" style="s2">computers do not understand humans</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">computers speak zeros and ones</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.060" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">now humans we speak code</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">the main source of nutrition programming</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">language so we say for example if else</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">function variable we do all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">all right so you can see we speak</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">different languages code is here zeros</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">and ones are here two different</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">languages now</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">there has to be a way of translating if</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">else function whatever two zeros and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">ones that process in the middle is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:56.960" style="s2">called compilation or</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.960" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">let me give you an example of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">interpretation and an example of</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">compilation so right now i&#39;m in turkey</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">here they speak turkish i speak english</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">so i don&#39;t understand if i&#39;m walking</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:13.320" style="s2">down the street and some turkish person</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:13.320" style="s2">comes to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">and they start speaking</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t know what interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">would do is that i will have literally</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.280" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">my friend here an interpreter that will</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">be speaking to my ear and translating</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">everything to english</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">i am getting some turkish message here</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">and my friend is immediately translating</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">everything into english to my ear that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">is interpretation it happens in real</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">now what is compilation compilation</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen in real time compilation</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">first my friend will go</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">my friend will listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">and then once my friend</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">understands the sentences once my friend</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">understands what they mean my friend</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">will translate the entire message to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">that is compilation versus</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">interpretation one of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">interpretation is done in real time and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">the other one is done not in real time</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s what makes a programming</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">language slower and faster for example</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">python is interpreted nc is compiled</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">so on python there is always a person</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">speaking to the computer the zeros and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">the ones that he needs to get for every</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">line and that could be slow that could</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">be a slow process because there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">always a middleman in the middle between</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">your python code and the zeros and ones</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">now when you work with something like c</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">is compiled that means that after you</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">finish your program you&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">compile the compiler will translate all</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">your code into zeros and once and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">you will be able to open your program</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">and of course it will be faster because</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">the there is no middleman there your</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">code will become zeros and once</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">immediately and when you open the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">program you&#39;ll be serious in once there</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">is no middleman there now another</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">example of this of why the difference</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">between interpretation versus</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">compilation if my friend is my</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">interpreter right here and the turkish</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:11.200" style="s2">person maybe he speaks a word that my</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">friend doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.200" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">my friend would say oop sorry i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">and then we&#39;re gonna be lost</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">right that would be interpretation now</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">if it was compilation and that turkish</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">person speaks to my friend some word he</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know my friend would stop it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">say like hey i don&#39;t know that word</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">change the word because i need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">translate that and i don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">that word that would be the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">in compilation and interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">when we have errors for example on</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">python for example or even javascript</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s an interpreted language</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">and it happens in real time my code</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">might have some errors and</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">i might</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know about these errors until they</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">happen and that is not good at all i</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">want to know about my errors before they</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">happen so i can fix them but because</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s interpreted it will be real time</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">now if it&#39;s compiled for example when</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:05.520" style="s2">you have a mistake on c</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">or any compiled language and you try to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.520" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">compile your program c will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">wait one second hold on that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">work i don&#39;t understand that fix it so</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">you know that once you compile your</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">software using the c compiler for</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">example you know that that code doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">have errors</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:24.320" style="s2">because the compiler</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">approved it basically of course if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">have an interpreter that is a middleman</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">if you don&#39;t you have all the power of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:31.520" style="s2">the zeros and ones and you can access</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">even deeper parts of the computers</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">without a middleman that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">little bit slow so that&#39;s it i know i</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">made big generalizations on this video</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">if you are already a programmer and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">you&#39;re experimented and you like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">theory then i know you&#39;re gonna disagree</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">with some things that i said but i allow</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">myself to generalize because that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">to explain concepts i know</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:54.079" style="s2">sometimes you can make python a compile</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">language there are ways of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.079" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">but generally python is interpreted and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">c is compiled</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:02.160" style="s2">all right thank you for watching i hope</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">that you understood a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.160" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">about how we communicate with computers</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">and i hope that you like my example of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">my turkeys and my translator and let me</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">know what you think let me know if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:13.520" style="s2">like this video share it with your</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">friends and don&#39;t worry about speed</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">really it&#39;s not a big deal to choose the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">fastest programming language in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">world not a big deal uh that&#39;s it thank</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">you very much thank you for watching see</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:25.720" style="s2">you in the next one eat kimchi be happy</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:25.720" style="s2">and bye</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">nicolas</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">today i am going to talk about the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">popular programming language in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">this programming language is javascript</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">even if you hate it or you love it</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing we can do javascript is</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">the most popular one now javascript is</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">not only a language that we use to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">websites with react or vue.js there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:52.640" style="s2">so much more that you can do with</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">javascript especially if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.640" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">designer or a creative artist or a media</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">person or a web publisher it is so much</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">more than you can do with javascript and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">that&#39;s why on this video i am going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">talk about the other uses of javascript</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">apart from website making</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">first you can make hybrid apps or</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:16.640" style="s2">cross-platform apps i know you heard</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">about hybrid apps before in</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.640" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">cross-platform apps on this channel so</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to talk too much about</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">that but if you want to make hybrid apps</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">with javascript look into something</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">called ionic or if you want to build</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">some cross platform apps look into</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:33.200" style="s2">something called react native hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">technology is used by amazon for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.200" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">their ios and android application is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">based on web and hybrid views also the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">wechat ecosystem is built around hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">apps and the react native side people</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">like discord tencent pinterest in some</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">parts of facebook and instagram are</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">built using react native so if you want</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">to be an app developer and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">javascript you can get started right</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">number two</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:05.440" style="s2">desktop software for mac windows and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">linux if you want to make software for</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.440" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">the desktop you can do that using</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">javascript and electron electron takes</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:15.119" style="s2">html css and javascript compiles it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">it will give you</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.119" end="00:42:20.079" style="s2">a windows linux or mac os</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">software ready to install in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.079" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">computer it&#39;s an awesome awesome tool</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">many of the big big projects that i</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">electron for example visual studio code</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">the most popular text editor in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">world is built using html css javascript</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">and electron also slack for desktop</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">of other applications so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">make desktop applications that your</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">users can install</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">go ahead all you need to know is html</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">css and javascript</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">now if you&#39;re a little bit more creative</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">and you like video games you can make 2d</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:06.920" style="s2">video games with javascript really</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">really easy you can use things like</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.920" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">phaser.js or impact js you can make</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">awesome 2d video games you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">write anything of the physics because</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">those engines already come with a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">javascript physics engine and you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">use the graphic cards power of the</p>

<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">running on the browser you can create</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">maybe really cool interactive websites</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">example to the oculus so that your users</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">can play on the browser or you can make</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">a website for example a shopping mall</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">learning on the browser for example you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">can make a 2d or 3d video game and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">can use tensorflow.js to maybe give the</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">changing the way that we see mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">and errors in our code a good programmer</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">is not a programmer that doesn&#39;t do any</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">mistakes or that always writes the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">perfect code without any syntax errors</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">that is not what a good programmer is</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">okay that shouldn&#39;t discourage you from</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.240" style="s2">becoming a programmer if you make many</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">mistakes you shouldn&#39;t feel like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">this is not for me no that is not what a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">good programmer is what a good</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">errors and learns and grows from those</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">mistakes if you make a mistake and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">grow from it that&#39;s when you become a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">good programmer okay so it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">that making mistakes is bad and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:39.200" style="s2">should try to never make any mistakes no</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">we should learn from our mistakes and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.200" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">should try to never make the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">mistake twice that&#39;s how we become a</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">good programmer okay so tip number one</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.750" style="s2">of mindset change when we see an error</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">working because of me so i should take</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">i now can fix the problem if you are the</p>

<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">be the solution of that problem okay but</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">if we just leave all responsibility</p>

<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">you what was the cause if we understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">the cause we are less likely to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">the error again so let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">understand the cause instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:13.100" style="s2">trying to make all the errors disappear</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy when we see an error to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.839" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">freak out and basically say oh it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">working again what happened and go back</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">and look at the code and google and ask</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">our friends it&#39;s very easy to do all</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">those things right but you know why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">easier than that reading the error</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">message and i know it sounds crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">it&#39;s something so obvious but even i</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:38.240" style="s2">forget to this day when something</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work i immediately go back to my</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.240" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">code and try to find a problem with my</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">code actually if you look at the error</p>

<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">most of the fixes of the way to fix of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">the source of the error of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">explanation of the error is on the error</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">message so sometimes i get people to ask</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">me why is this error happening and i say</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">just read the error message it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">literally there they&#39;re telling you what</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">you did wrong and they&#39;re telling you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">how you can fix it</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">so again</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s something so simple and so basic</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:07.839" style="s2">and so obvious but we forget about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">and i forget about it i also get</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.839" end="00:51:10.880" style="s2">stressed i also want to make the error</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">disappear i also want to be like what</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.880" end="00:51:14.480" style="s2">happened i want to go back and look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">my code well actually all i should do is</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.480" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">look at the error message and read it it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">might look intimidating because error</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">messages don&#39;t look nice when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">programmer it&#39;s a bunch of code and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">there is one line that says exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:27.359" style="s2">you need to do to fix it so we can look</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">at it and if we don&#39;t be careful and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.359" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">don&#39;t read them carefully it just looks</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:32.559" style="s2">like gibberish but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">something there so let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.559" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">error messages a little bit more closely</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">because the people that make the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">libraries that we use the people that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">make the programs that we use they put</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">those error messages there for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">they tell you how to fix it they&#39;ll tell</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">careful set realistic goals it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:45.680" style="s2">do a dumb project like a calculator or a</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">small web scraper or a very tiny video</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.680" end="00:53:50.720" style="s2">game that&#39;s also okay the point is to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">always build something create</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.720" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">write code then you study read and</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">number two is not knowing when you are</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">ready this happens a lot to beginners</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">because they feel like they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">learned enough yet they feel like still</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:12.880" style="s2">they have to take one more course they</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">have to read one more book they have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">watch one more lecture they don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:19.280" style="s2">ready to go and apply for a job or to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">start their own company and build their</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.280" end="00:54:23.599" style="s2">own product so how to avoid this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">very easy go back to the point number</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:28.480" style="s2">one of this video build</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:31.280" style="s2">things when you build something your</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.480" end="00:54:34.079" style="s2">eyes and your brain see a visual</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">representation and a result of all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">knowledge that you&#39;ve been accumulating</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.319" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">in your head and that tells your brain</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">that you are ready</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">simple that gives you the confidence to</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">know hey i built that that means i am</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">ready usually the people that get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">in the always learning phase the ones</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">that keep buying books the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">keep buying courses the ones that keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">reading stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">those are the ones that are not building</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">everything that you&#39;ve got that day why</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">not because you are gonna wake up the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">next day feeling like because</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:30.240" style="s2">everything hurts and you are probably</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:33.040" style="s2">not gonna go to the gym that day or the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.240" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">next day when the point is to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.040" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">gym every day to train every day is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">same with programming the point is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">program every day the point is to build</p>

<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">and you forget your hobbies you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen programming is not a list</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:56:58.720" style="s2">of boxes that you check</p>

<p begin="00:57:03.280" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">gonna be a box to check you are never</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like a rainbow instead of having a</p>

<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">want to make so for example make a chat</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.960" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">now first let me start by saying that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.559" end="01:00:29.760" style="s2">both libraries and frameworks are code</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:31.839" style="s2">that somebody else wrote that we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.760" end="01:00:34.400" style="s2">using in our project okay so both</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.839" end="01:00:36.880" style="s2">external things that we use to finish</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.400" end="01:00:40.319" style="s2">things faster the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.880" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">library and framework lies on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.319" end="01:00:45.119" style="s2">very simple concept who is controlling</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:47.839" style="s2">who okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.119" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">are you in control of your code are you</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.839" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">the one making all the choices or are</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.079" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">you following someone else&#39;s rules and</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:56.799" style="s2">that basically is the whole difference</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.640" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">between a library and a framework do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">control the code do you control exactly</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">what&#39;s happening or are you following</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">rules okay let me give you an example</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:07.839" style="s2">a good example of a library is jquery</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">jquery allows you to basically add</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.839" end="01:01:12.079" style="s2">interactivity to a website right</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">now this means that when i&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.079" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">my website when i&#39;m working on some code</p>

<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">will call jquery when i need jquery okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.559" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">so if i need jquery right now i will</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">call jquery i will use a query and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">i will keep going on my program this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.680" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">how we use libraries we use libraries</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">when we need them and libraries are very</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:36.400" style="s2">easy to be replaced if i change the</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:15.680" style="s2">happens and how it happens no the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:17.760" style="s2">framework tells you what to do the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.680" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">framework tells you where to put your</p>

<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:25.119" style="s2">so the framework gives you rules the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.559" end="01:02:27.039" style="s2">framework gives you a structure where to</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.119" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">put your template where to pull your</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.039" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">controllers where to put your views</p>

<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:39.920" style="s2">you just follow the friendliest rules</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:41.680" style="s2">one example of a framework is the jungle</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.920" end="01:02:43.839" style="s2">world framework the django web framework</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.680" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">has a lot of rules and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.839" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">structure that you have to follow if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">want everything to work correctly for</p>

<p begin="01:02:48.559" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">on the jungle framework if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">have an admin panel you need to write</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.920" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">your code on the file called admin that</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">pi</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">if you want to change</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">any sort of url</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:04.680" style="s2">you are going to have to go to the file</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.839" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.680" end="01:03:11.599" style="s2">urls.pi and when django starts django is</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">going to look for a file called url.pi</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.599" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">and admin.pi</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">you are not in control of this this is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">rule that django has and now if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">follow the rules correctly you are going</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:23.920" style="s2">to have a website with an admin panel</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:24.880" style="s2">and with the urls working so as you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.920" end="01:03:27.200" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">never in this scenario</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.200" end="01:03:33.280" style="s2">i called django never i just look at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">django documentation i follow the rules</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.280" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">i put my code on the right places and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">django will load those things</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.280" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">everything that is a framework is</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">because it has some rules that we must</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">follow everything that is a library is</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:50.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s something that we call when</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">we feel like it i call a library</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.880" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">but a framework calls me</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s very important and</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">interesting the extension to make all</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:00.000" style="s2">right so next time you see something</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.000" end="01:04:04.319" style="s2">library to build blah blah blah you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">that is something that you are going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.319" end="01:04:08.640" style="s2">call when you need it but next time you</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">see something that says a framework for</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.640" end="01:04:12.799" style="s2">building whatever you know that this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">something that comes with some rules</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">something that comes with opinions and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:18.720" style="s2">something that you are going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">cooperate with basically where you are</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.720" end="01:04:22.480" style="s2">in control you just need to work under</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:24.400" style="s2">the frameworks rules</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.480" end="01:04:26.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.400" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">if you go for example to the react.js</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:32.160" style="s2">website on the react.js website it says</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:33.200" style="s2">that react.js is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.160" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">library</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.200" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">so it means that if you need to build</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">the ui of your application then that</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:42.400" style="s2">means that you are going to have to call</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:45.280" style="s2">react right in this case we are calling</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.400" end="01:04:47.760" style="s2">react so that would make react.js a</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.280" end="01:04:50.799" style="s2">library because we are calling it when</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.760" end="01:04:53.200" style="s2">we need a user interface and react.js</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.799" end="01:04:54.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come with any sort of opinions</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.200" end="01:04:56.799" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t come with a folder structure</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.960" end="01:04:58.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t come with a component name</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.799" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come with anything</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.480" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">except that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.079" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">react.js calls our components</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.839" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">so in this case react.js could be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:09.440" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">because react.js is calling your</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.440" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">component react.js is telling you the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2">rules react.js is telling you what is</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:19.039" style="s2">wrong and what is right and when you</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">write a component react calls that</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.039" end="01:05:24.000" style="s2">component and shows it on the screen so</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">in this case it&#39;s a very gray area and</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.000" end="01:05:27.760" style="s2">you can google around and see if</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">reactions is a framework or a library</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.760" end="01:05:31.920" style="s2">because some people say that react.js is</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">a library because you call it when you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.920" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">need it but also react.js could be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">framework because react.js calls our</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">components and react.js makes our</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:44.240" style="s2">components interactive and react.js</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.160" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">gives our components a state and props</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.240" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">and all that this also applies to vue.js</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:48.640" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:50.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.640" end="01:05:52.319" style="s2">does it matter if react.js is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.400" end="01:05:54.240" style="s2">framework or a library it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.319" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">matter because on the front end all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.240" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">lines are blurred but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">important that you and i know what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:02.559" style="s2">difference or at least in the theory</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference between a</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.559" end="01:06:06.640" style="s2">framework and a library in case we get</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.720" end="01:07:58.799" style="s2">javascript which is an awesome thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:08:01.039" style="s2">bad thing about this is that you have to</p>

<p begin="01:08:01.039" end="01:08:05.839" style="s2">all the ui by yourself or the all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:08.400" style="s2">buttons all the navigations because</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.839" end="01:08:11.280" style="s2">you&#39;re basically making a website from</p>

<p begin="01:08:11.280" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">all the power of the phone you cannot do</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">for example some hardcore video</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.000" end="01:08:19.600" style="s2">processing it would be too hard to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:22.000" style="s2">that on javascript because what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.600" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">doing is just a website what you can do</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.000" end="01:08:27.199" style="s2">on a hybrid application is get some</p>

<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:32.880" style="s2">information some contacts but not as</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.719" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">much as maybe your application would</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.880" end="01:08:37.199" style="s2">like if you want to make hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">applications look into something called</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.199" end="01:08:43.600" style="s2">apache cordoba or funga these are the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.560" end="01:08:45.839" style="s2">services that wrap your html</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.600" end="01:08:48.080" style="s2">around that webview cross-platform</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.839" end="01:08:51.040" style="s2">applications cross-platform applications</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.080" end="01:08:54.319" style="s2">are basically when you write some sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.040" end="01:08:58.239" style="s2">of code that is not a native code but</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.319" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">later on gets translated into code that</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.239" end="01:09:03.199" style="s2">ios and android can understand for</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:06.480" style="s2">example react native all you have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.199" end="01:09:09.520" style="s2">write is react code that gets compiled</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.480" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">into some javascript code and then ios</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.520" end="01:09:15.199" style="s2">and android execute that javascript code</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">with their own javascript engine in</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.199" end="01:09:21.120" style="s2">flutter you write dart code and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:23.600" style="s2">gets compiled to cc plus plus that both</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.120" end="01:09:26.159" style="s2">ios and android can understand and in</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:27.600" style="s2">summary which is what c</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.159" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">sharp</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.600" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">you write c sharp code and that gets</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:35.920" style="s2">compiled into some sort of intermediate</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">language that ios and android can</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.920" end="01:09:41.040" style="s2">understand so as you can see you are not</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:43.520" style="s2">writing native code but your code is</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.040" end="01:09:45.440" style="s2">eventually going to these native</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.520" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">platforms the good things about this</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.440" end="01:09:49.600" style="s2">method is that you only have to write</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">your application once and you can see it</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.600" end="01:09:55.280" style="s2">in two platforms which is awesome</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">because you can reuse developer time</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:59.679" style="s2">if i&#39;m a react developer i can make a</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:02.560" style="s2">react native app very very very easy for</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.679" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">example also if you&#39;re a dart developer</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.560" end="01:10:06.719" style="s2">you will be able to make an ios app</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">android and also your website because</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.719" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">now we have something called flutter web</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:13.679" style="s2">which is nice a very good thing of cross</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">platform development is that it attracts</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.679" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">many many people from many different</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">backgrounds maybe a back-end developer</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:21.840" style="s2">wants to make an app or react native</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.679" end="01:10:25.360" style="s2">maybe a java developer and what you get</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.840" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">is just an amazing mix of ideas</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.360" end="01:10:29.440" style="s2">libraries tutorials and just the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:31.520" style="s2">community is great because</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.440" end="01:10:33.679" style="s2">cross-platform is a very very attractive</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.520" end="01:10:37.600" style="s2">thing for development a bad thing is</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.679" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">that still is not native so still</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.600" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">you will have some performance issues if</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:43.920" style="s2">while you need its performance don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">me wrong cross-platform applications are</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.920" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">not slow</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.199" end="01:10:49.760" style="s2">if you use them for the right job they</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">are just the best solution for example</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.760" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">some parts of instagram run on react</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:57.199" style="s2">native but if you do</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:11:00.400" style="s2">need performance those applications</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.199" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">might be a little bit slow on that case</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.400" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">because as i told you there is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">translation step that might not allow</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">you to reach into the power of the phone</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:14.480" style="s2">native development is basically just</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">writing ios code and android code</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.480" end="01:11:19.120" style="s2">separately so for ios you will learn</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:21.679" style="s2">something like swift and for android you</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.120" end="01:11:23.760" style="s2">learn something like java or cotton good</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:25.600" style="s2">things about this is that you have as</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.760" end="01:11:27.920" style="s2">much power as the phone has and you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.600" end="01:11:30.719" style="s2">use whatever api is available because</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.920" end="01:11:32.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no middleman between your code</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.719" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">and the phone bad things about native</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.880" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">development is that you will have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:38.800" style="s2">learn two separate platforms</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">ios and android you have to learn street</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.800" end="01:11:43.280" style="s2">you have to learn java they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.960" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">different and they do things differently</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.280" end="01:11:48.640" style="s2">also you need to learn about xcode and</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">android studio both separate uh software</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.640" end="01:11:53.360" style="s2">to create applications so it&#39;s just more</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">time consuming but if performance is</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.360" end="01:11:57.360" style="s2">what you want then</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:11:59.760" style="s2">maybe learning two platforms is going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.360" end="01:12:03.600" style="s2">pay off in the future like maybe making</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.760" end="01:12:05.600" style="s2">a camera app that puts a 3d</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.600" end="01:12:07.760" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to need all the power</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.600" end="01:12:09.840" style="s2">you can get and the power comes from</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.760" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">native development</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.840" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">that&#39;s it thank you for watching i hope</p>

<p begin="01:14:40.560" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">here is where machine learning comes</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.560" end="01:14:45.920" style="s2">machine learning is the way to</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.560" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.920" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">ai so how do machines learn there are</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.239" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">many categories of machine learning but</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:53.440" style="s2">the most famous ones</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:56.560" style="s2">are two</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.440" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">on unsupervised learning and super</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.560" end="01:15:00.640" style="s2">biased learning let&#39;s say that we are</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">going to make an application that</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.640" end="01:15:08.280" style="s2">detects if a food is a hot dog or not a</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:08.280" style="s2">hot dog</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.840" end="01:15:20.320" style="s2">if we did it in a supervised way what we</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.880" end="01:15:24.880" style="s2">will do is that we will label</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.320" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">what a hot dog is okay a hot dog is a</p>

<p begin="01:15:33.760" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">that is a label we&#39;re going to label</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.800" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">what a hot dog is we&#39;re going to tell</p>

<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">and then we are going to get millions of</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.760" end="01:15:48.960" style="s2">photos of any kind of food we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:49.920" style="s2">to put that into the machine in the</p>

<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:01.360" style="s2">chance of being a hotdog so the machine</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.520" end="01:16:03.840" style="s2">is not thinking the machine is just</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.840" end="01:16:17.520" style="s2">humans gave to the machine</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.199" end="01:16:19.760" style="s2">one example of supervised machine</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.520" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">learning would be for example a music</p>

<p begin="01:16:24.880" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">the songs that we like so we will tell</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.800" end="01:16:30.320" style="s2">the machine these are the songs that i</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.480" end="01:16:32.080" style="s2">enjoy this is the kind of beat that i</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.320" end="01:16:34.640" style="s2">enjoy this is the kind of artist that i</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.080" end="01:16:37.120" style="s2">like next time a new song comes the</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.640" end="01:16:40.000" style="s2">machine now has labeled data into what</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.120" end="01:16:42.719" style="s2">is a song that nicolas likes and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.000" end="01:16:45.360" style="s2">you will know if nicolas has a 90 chance</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.719" end="01:16:49.440" style="s2">of liking this new song that&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.360" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">that is supervised learning humans label</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.440" end="01:16:55.600" style="s2">the data now in unsupervised learning</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:58.080" style="s2">the humans do not label the data so for</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.600" end="01:16:59.600" style="s2">example to do this hot dog app what we</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.080" end="01:17:01.600" style="s2">are going to do is that we are going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.600" end="01:17:03.920" style="s2">give to the machine millions of photos</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.600" end="01:17:05.520" style="s2">of only hot dogs we&#39;re going to give</p>

<p begin="01:17:05.520" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">give the machine any labels and we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.920" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">going to let the machine by itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:14.719" style="s2">figure out a label</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:16.320" style="s2">that makes a hotdog so we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.719" end="01:17:18.159" style="s2">to tell any description of a hot dog</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.320" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">we&#39;re just going to give the machine a</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.159" end="01:17:23.760" style="s2">lot of hotdog photos and the machine</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.880" end="01:17:26.239" style="s2">will figure out by itself after a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.760" end="01:17:29.360" style="s2">time and a lot of processing power and a</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.239" end="01:17:30.880" style="s2">lot a lot of data all right now of</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.360" end="01:17:32.640" style="s2">course i know</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.880" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">this is just a very simple explanation</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.640" end="01:17:36.560" style="s2">if you want this if you like this topic</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:38.400" style="s2">we can talk more about it in future</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">videos but now i need to move on to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.400" end="01:17:44.400" style="s2">last topic which is deep learning deep</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:46.320" style="s2">learning is just a way to accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.400" end="01:17:50.080" style="s2">machine learning machine learning is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.320" end="01:17:52.000" style="s2">way to accomplish ai</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.080" end="01:17:55.199" style="s2">deep learning is called deep learning</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.000" end="01:17:57.199" style="s2">because it makes use of something called</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.199" end="01:17:58.960" style="s2">neural networks</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.199" end="01:18:01.040" style="s2">very smart scientists very smart</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.960" end="01:18:02.719" style="s2">mathematicians and computer scientists</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.040" end="01:18:07.520" style="s2">and all that they came up with this</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.719" end="01:18:09.920" style="s2">algorithm that works like a brain</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.520" end="01:18:11.360" style="s2">you need a lot of data to train that and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.920" end="01:18:12.960" style="s2">you need a lot of processing power</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.360" end="01:18:14.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.960" end="01:18:17.280" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.159" end="01:18:19.199" style="s2">and computer intensive process but</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.280" end="01:18:20.640" style="s2">that&#39;s it deep learning is a way to</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:23.120" style="s2">accomplish machine learning machine</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.640" end="01:18:25.360" style="s2">learning is a way to accomplish ai all</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.120" end="01:18:28.159" style="s2">right now deep learning is being used by</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.360" end="01:18:31.040" style="s2">companies for example like google or</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.159" end="01:18:33.679" style="s2">google or tesla for example because they</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.040" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">can process and have massive amounts of</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.679" end="01:18:36.800" style="s2">data and they have massive amounts of</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:39.840" style="s2">money so</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.800" end="01:18:41.679" style="s2">how does a full stack programmer come up</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.840" end="01:18:43.040" style="s2">and start working with machine learning</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.679" end="01:18:44.640" style="s2">and deep learning well if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.040" end="01:18:47.120" style="s2">get started in machine learning you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.640" end="01:18:49.920" style="s2">to learn python that is like the best</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.120" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">way to get started if you know python</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.920" end="01:18:53.600" style="s2">then you can move on and look into</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:55.199" style="s2">something called tensorflow thankfully</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.600" end="01:18:57.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to do all these things by</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.199" end="01:18:58.800" style="s2">yourself manually you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.120" end="01:19:01.280" style="s2">create the neural networks by yourself</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.800" end="01:19:03.520" style="s2">the community has already built tons and</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.280" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">tons of things the most popular</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:08.080" style="s2">framework for artificial intelligence is</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:10.080" style="s2">called tensorflow tensorflow is on</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.080" end="01:19:12.159" style="s2">javascript and python so those two</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.080" end="01:19:13.600" style="s2">languages are super super easy to get</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.159" end="01:19:15.600" style="s2">started with and you can get started</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.600" end="01:19:19.040" style="s2">tomorrow if you wanted to also there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.600" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">this thing called brain js on brain.js</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.040" end="01:19:22.400" style="s2">they already have neural networks deep</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.199" end="01:19:24.719" style="s2">learning algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:27.440" style="s2">activation functions i&#39;ll cheat on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.719" end="01:19:29.920" style="s2">things already done for you to work with</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.440" end="01:19:32.080" style="s2">deep learning and node.js so if you ask</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.920" end="01:19:34.400" style="s2">me it&#39;s an amazing thing like i said the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.080" end="01:19:36.320" style="s2">community has already built so many</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.400" end="01:19:38.080" style="s2">things so if you&#39;re scared of math</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.320" end="01:19:40.320" style="s2">calculus and all that you can go and</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.080" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">start playing around with tensorflow or</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.320" end="01:19:43.920" style="s2">with brain.js and that will just give</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:45.760" style="s2">you an introduction of what is machine</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.920" end="01:19:48.080" style="s2">learning without having to take care of</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.760" end="01:19:50.159" style="s2">all the math and the calculus python and</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.080" end="01:19:52.080" style="s2">javascript those two languages are going</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.159" end="01:19:53.920" style="s2">to be big big big big on machine</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.080" end="01:19:56.159" style="s2">learning i think python already is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.920" end="01:19:57.600" style="s2">massive and javascript is starting there</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.159" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s on the web</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.600" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">thank you for watching i hope that you</p>

<p begin="01:21:59.440" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">back there on your servers far away</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.960" end="01:22:07.520" style="s2">that is basically an api now what is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:10.400" style="s2">rest api what is a graphql api what is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.520" end="01:22:12.719" style="s2">soap api what is an xml api these are</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.400" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">just different shapes of keyboards but</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.719" end="01:22:18.320" style="s2">they accomplish the same thing they let</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:19.920" style="s2">programs communicate with each other but</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.320" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">this is not the only api that you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.920" end="01:22:23.840" style="s2">find you can also find public apis there</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">are weather weather apis which is a</p>

<p begin="01:22:36.159" end="01:22:41.199" style="s2">those are just keyboards that your</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.080" end="01:22:44.880" style="s2">program can use to interact with those</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.199" end="01:22:47.120" style="s2">applications with those servers now apis</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.880" end="01:22:49.280" style="s2">are designed by the people that have the</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.120" end="01:22:51.520" style="s2">server and that are making the api so</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.280" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">for example some apis they don&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.520" end="01:22:55.440" style="s2">you to do everything sometimes the apis</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:57.120" style="s2">come with limitations sometimes you have</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.440" end="01:23:00.000" style="s2">to pay for access to the keyword</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.120" end="01:23:02.560" style="s2">sometimes you can only send maybe 10</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.000" end="01:23:05.120" style="s2">requests per second there is another</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.560" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">kind of api which is for example the web</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.120" end="01:23:10.800" style="s2">api web apis are apis</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.480" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">made for the browser for google chrome</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.800" end="01:23:16.480" style="s2">for firefox for all that and those are</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.360" end="01:23:19.840" style="s2">the same thing the the chrome team the</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.480" end="01:23:21.920" style="s2">firefox team the safari team they all</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.840" end="01:23:23.760" style="s2">buttons for you to use</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.920" end="01:23:26.719" style="s2">every time there is a new button popping</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.760" end="01:23:28.639" style="s2">up and before the api was really really</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.719" end="01:23:31.520" style="s2">small like this small</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.639" end="01:23:33.280" style="s2">only this part was the api but now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.520" end="01:23:35.520" style="s2">been growing so now we have buttons for</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.280" end="01:23:38.159" style="s2">example that if i press this button i</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.520" end="01:23:40.320" style="s2">can request access to the user</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.159" end="01:23:43.440" style="s2">microphone if i play if i press this</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.320" end="01:23:46.719" style="s2">button i can also request access to the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.440" end="01:23:49.280" style="s2">user camera if i press another button i</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.719" end="01:23:52.239" style="s2">request access to the geolocation so</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.280" end="01:23:53.199" style="s2">those are just buttons that you press</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.239" end="01:23:54.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.199" end="01:23:58.000" style="s2">have some result you don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.960" end="01:24:00.560" style="s2">internals of that job you don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.000" end="01:24:02.560" style="s2">internals of how chrome is getting my</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.560" end="01:24:04.880" style="s2">location you don&#39;t see the internals of</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.560" end="01:24:06.560" style="s2">how firefox is getting my audio you</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.880" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">don&#39;t do any of that they just give you</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.560" end="01:24:10.560" style="s2">a button and when you press it many</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:12.159" style="s2">things happen under it but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.560" end="01:24:13.679" style="s2">your problem and that&#39;s why everybody</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.159" end="01:24:15.600" style="s2">loves an api they have different</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.679" end="01:24:18.480" style="s2">purposes but they do the same thing they</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.600" end="01:24:20.719" style="s2">just expose buttons that then you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.480" end="01:24:23.040" style="s2">press with your code</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.719" end="01:24:25.360" style="s2">and that will that will have some uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.040" end="01:24:27.440" style="s2">result at the end so do you need an api</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.360" end="01:24:29.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t need an api it depends on your</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.440" end="01:24:31.520" style="s2">needs should you build an api out of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.040" end="01:24:33.520" style="s2">nowhere it depends on your needs should</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.520" end="01:24:35.280" style="s2">you learn how to make an api of course</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.520" end="01:24:37.280" style="s2">you should you can learn that in other</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.280" end="01:24:38.719" style="s2">courses or everywhere in the world thank</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.280" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">you for watching i hope that you like</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.719" end="01:24:42.560" style="s2">this tiny tiny explanation let me know</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.800" end="01:24:44.159" style="s2">what other newbie questions you have i</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.560" end="01:24:46.400" style="s2">would love to answer them on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.159" end="01:24:49.840" style="s2">comments or on another video and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.400" end="01:24:51.600" style="s2">it again thank you and i will see you on</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.840" end="01:24:54.000" style="s2">the next one</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.600" end="01:24:58.199" style="s2">don&#39;t forget as always</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.000" end="01:24:58.199" style="s2">eat kimchi bye</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.159" end="01:25:04.880" style="s2">and today we are going to talk about why</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.400" end="01:25:07.120" style="s2">domains cost money when you pay for a</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.880" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2">domain why do you have to pay for that</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.120" end="01:25:11.199" style="s2">com and where is that money going what</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.280" end="01:25:13.440" style="s2">is the domain factory and what would it</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.199" end="01:25:16.480" style="s2">take if i want to create a new domain</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.440" end="01:25:18.080" style="s2">like for example that kimchi so to</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.480" end="01:25:21.520" style="s2">understand this first we need to learn</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.080" end="01:25:23.520" style="s2">how the domain system works</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.520" end="01:25:25.440" style="s2">websites are just computers connected to</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.520" end="01:25:27.440" style="s2">the internet and the way computers find</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.440" end="01:25:30.239" style="s2">each other is by the ip address and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.440" end="01:25:32.159" style="s2">ip address is just a very long series of</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.239" end="01:25:34.560" style="s2">numbers but it will be very very</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.159" end="01:25:36.480" style="s2">inefficient if instead of me saying hey</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.560" end="01:25:38.440" style="s2">go to nomadcollege.com i would say</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.480" end="01:25:41.360" style="s2">something like go to</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.440" end="01:25:43.120" style="s2">192.168. that will be really really bad</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.360" end="01:25:44.800" style="s2">so what we came up with to fix this</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.120" end="01:25:46.800" style="s2">problem is something called the domain</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.800" end="01:25:49.520" style="s2">name system the domain name system is</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.800" end="01:25:51.679" style="s2">basically a big phone book that has the</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.520" end="01:25:54.320" style="s2">address of your website and then their</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.679" end="01:25:56.480" style="s2">ip address so when you go to google.com</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.320" end="01:25:57.840" style="s2">on your browser your browser will ask</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.480" end="01:26:00.080" style="s2">that phone book</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.840" end="01:26:02.719" style="s2">google.com ip address and then you will</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.080" end="01:26:04.719" style="s2">be taken to that ip address now the</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.719" end="01:26:06.960" style="s2">thing is it will be very very bad and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.719" end="01:26:08.639" style="s2">inefficient if we only had one phone</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.960" end="01:26:11.360" style="s2">book because there are millions of</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.639" end="01:26:13.520" style="s2">domain names so actually what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.360" end="01:26:15.679" style="s2">not that there is one phone book that</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.520" end="01:26:18.639" style="s2">knows everything but there is one phone</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.679" end="01:26:21.040" style="s2">book that knows who knows what that</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.639" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">means is that when you go to google.com</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.040" end="01:26:25.920" style="s2">you&#39;re going to go and ask to the root</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:28.000" style="s2">phone book of all and then you will say</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.920" end="01:26:29.040" style="s2">hey where is google.com and they will</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.000" end="01:26:31.600" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.040" end="01:26:35.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t know where google.com is but we</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.600" end="01:26:37.120" style="s2">know who knows and they send you to that</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.040" end="01:26:39.280" style="s2">that place where they send you is also</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.120" end="01:26:41.679" style="s2">another phone book and this is called a</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.280" end="01:26:43.520" style="s2">registry and registries are run by</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.679" end="01:26:45.920" style="s2">private companies in this case for</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.520" end="01:26:47.920" style="s2">example the dot com registry is run by a</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.920" end="01:26:50.560" style="s2">company called verisign which is one of</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.920" end="01:26:52.639" style="s2">the biggest companies four domain names</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.560" end="01:26:54.880" style="s2">running a registry is not an easy job</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.639" end="01:26:57.199" style="s2">but it&#39;s a very profitable one a</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.880" end="01:27:00.320" style="s2">registry basically has to handle all the</p>

<p begin="01:27:07.600" end="01:27:12.400" style="s2">bandwidth they have to have the security</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.840" end="01:27:15.360" style="s2">all that stuff and as you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.400" end="01:27:18.159" style="s2">there are many many tiny other books for</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.360" end="01:27:21.120" style="s2">example that co is another registry that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.159" end="01:27:22.719" style="s2">code.kr is another registry that tv is</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.120" end="01:27:25.120" style="s2">another registry all these are</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.719" end="01:27:26.960" style="s2">registries remember registries are just</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.120" end="01:27:30.239" style="s2">books with the address</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.960" end="01:27:32.080" style="s2">and the ip so registries are the domain</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.239" end="01:27:35.920" style="s2">factories they are the ones with the</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.080" end="01:27:37.520" style="s2">books that come here that come here they</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.920" end="01:27:39.840" style="s2">know this but they don&#39;t sell the</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.520" end="01:27:41.520" style="s2">domains to the public for example if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.840" end="01:27:43.679" style="s2">want to buy a domain right now you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.520" end="01:27:47.440" style="s2">go to verisign you go to one of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.679" end="01:27:49.280" style="s2">domain resellers so godaddy let&#39;s say is</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.440" end="01:27:51.920" style="s2">a domain reseller and when you go to</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.280" end="01:27:54.480" style="s2">godaddy you pay them a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.920" end="01:27:56.719" style="s2">of what that dot com domain cost for</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.480" end="01:28:00.320" style="s2">example in the case of verisign that com</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.719" end="01:28:02.000" style="s2">domain cost 7.5 from them but if you go</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.320" end="01:28:04.199" style="s2">right now to godaddy or whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.000" end="01:28:05.920" style="s2">company you are going to pay more than</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.199" end="01:28:07.679" style="s2">7.5</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.920" end="01:28:10.239" style="s2">this is because the people that you are</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.679" end="01:28:12.719" style="s2">buying the domain from are the middlemen</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.239" end="01:28:15.520" style="s2">and they handle the users the password</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.719" end="01:28:17.040" style="s2">the support the renewing all that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.520" end="01:28:19.360" style="s2">they handle that and that&#39;s why you have</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.040" end="01:28:22.000" style="s2">to pay them so for example if you buy a</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.360" end="01:28:23.600" style="s2">dot com domain from me you will pay me</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.000" end="01:28:24.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say 30</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.600" end="01:28:28.159" style="s2">i take 30</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.960" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">i thank you very much and i pay 7.5 to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.159" end="01:28:34.000" style="s2">verizon and verisign will add your</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:35.679" style="s2">domain to the list now how can i create</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.000" end="01:28:37.040" style="s2">my own registry because maybe i want to</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.679" end="01:28:38.880" style="s2">have a new domain and i want to say you</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.040" end="01:28:40.800" style="s2">know what i want to sell that dimgy</p>

<p begin="01:28:40.800" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">domain and the way you can run your own</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.719" end="01:28:48.800" style="s2">registry is by applying to the i can the</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:50.239" style="s2">icon is an organization that handles all</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.800" end="01:28:53.280" style="s2">these domain things and they are the</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.239" end="01:28:56.320" style="s2">ones that sort of hold the key of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.280" end="01:28:58.719" style="s2">big and main root domain so for example</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.320" end="01:29:00.480" style="s2">if i say hey can you please put me there</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.719" end="01:29:02.400" style="s2">in the dark kimchi so if somebody asked</p>

<p begin="01:29:02.400" end="01:29:07.360" style="s2">me this is the icon and the application</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.960" end="01:29:09.920" style="s2">cost 185</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.360" end="01:29:12.000" style="s2">000 and you need to prove that this</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.920" end="01:29:13.360" style="s2">domain will improve the internet you</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.000" end="01:29:15.520" style="s2">also need to prove that you have the</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.360" end="01:29:17.199" style="s2">technology you have the customer support</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.520" end="01:29:18.880" style="s2">you have the infrastructure and you have</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.199" end="01:29:21.040" style="s2">the money to be able to support</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.880" end="01:29:23.120" style="s2">questions to your registry because</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.040" end="01:29:24.639" style="s2">having a registry is not an easy job as</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.120" end="01:29:26.480" style="s2">i said you&#39;re going to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.639" end="01:29:28.960" style="s2">questions of people asking you where is</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.480" end="01:29:31.440" style="s2">i love that kimchi where is it</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.960" end="01:29:33.040" style="s2">these things cost money but the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.440" end="01:29:34.800" style="s2">that once you have your own registry you</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.040" end="01:29:36.960" style="s2">can do almost whatever you want with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.800" end="01:29:38.880" style="s2">domain you can choose to sell them or</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.960" end="01:29:41.920" style="s2">maybe not sell them so for example i can</p>

<p begin="01:31:54.560" end="01:31:59.199" style="s2">are the bad parts and who should be</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.639" end="01:32:01.600" style="s2">using it</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.199" end="01:32:05.040" style="s2">serverless is changing the way that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.600" end="01:32:07.440" style="s2">build applications and how we design</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.040" end="01:32:09.520" style="s2">backends but there seems to be some</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.440" end="01:32:11.760" style="s2">confusion around what serverless</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.520" end="01:32:12.639" style="s2">actually is and this is because of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.760" end="01:32:15.120" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.639" end="01:32:17.840" style="s2">server less literally means without a</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.120" end="01:32:20.800" style="s2">server so people think that serverless</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.840" end="01:32:23.040" style="s2">means back-ends without servers and that</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.800" end="01:32:25.760" style="s2">would be impossible because you still</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.040" end="01:32:28.880" style="s2">need a server the code has to go</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.760" end="01:32:31.280" style="s2">somewhere so serverless doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.880" end="01:32:33.280" style="s2">back-ends without servers it actually</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.280" end="01:32:36.800" style="s2">means something more like</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.280" end="01:32:38.880" style="s2">back-ends without managing your own</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.800" end="01:32:41.440" style="s2">servers it&#39;s longer and it doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.880" end="01:32:43.600" style="s2">so sexy so that&#39;s why i guess they chose</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.440" end="01:32:45.920" style="s2">server less to understand the problems</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.600" end="01:32:48.719" style="s2">that serverless solves first we need to</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.920" end="01:32:51.120" style="s2">understand how we used to deploy</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.719" end="01:32:53.760" style="s2">applications before you had to go to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.120" end="01:32:55.840" style="s2">store and buy your own server and put it</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.760" end="01:32:58.400" style="s2">in your living room and plug it in by</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.840" end="01:33:01.120" style="s2">yourself and this meant that you had to</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.400" end="01:33:04.560" style="s2">manage the software and the hardware of</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.120" end="01:33:06.639" style="s2">the server so if for example your house</p>

<p begin="01:33:06.639" end="01:33:12.159" style="s2">server was down or if somebody unplugged</p>

<p begin="01:33:12.159" end="01:33:16.480" style="s2">if your website was too popular and you</p>

<p begin="01:33:18.800" end="01:33:23.280" style="s2">run to the store and buy a memory and</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.040" end="01:33:25.679" style="s2">put it in your server you had to do it</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.280" end="01:33:26.560" style="s2">all manually by yourself in your living</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.679" end="01:33:29.120" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.560" end="01:33:32.639" style="s2">then on the 2000s amazon came with a</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.120" end="01:33:35.199" style="s2">product called ec2 elastic compute cloud</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.639" end="01:33:37.760" style="s2">and now instead of having a server in</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.199" end="01:33:40.719" style="s2">your living room you can just pay amazon</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.760" end="01:33:43.199" style="s2">and rent a space on a server that they</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.719" end="01:33:44.800" style="s2">control and that they take error so now</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.199" end="01:33:47.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to worry about anybody</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.800" end="01:33:49.120" style="s2">plugging out the cable or the energy</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.040" end="01:33:51.679" style="s2">going down or your server not being big</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.120" end="01:33:53.440" style="s2">enough because with amazon you can just</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.679" end="01:33:55.360" style="s2">pay for more storage and they will just</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.440" end="01:33:57.840" style="s2">add more storage they will add more</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.360" end="01:34:00.639" style="s2">memory to your server we are renting a</p>

<p begin="01:34:00.639" end="01:34:05.199" style="s2">microsoft they are the ones keeping the</p>

<p begin="01:34:05.199" end="01:34:11.360" style="s2">hardware related issues but still we</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.800" end="01:34:13.840" style="s2">need to manage the software of our</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.360" end="01:34:16.239" style="s2">server we are just renting an empty</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.840" end="01:34:18.400" style="s2">server somewhere we have to put the</p>

<p begin="01:34:18.400" end="01:34:22.800" style="s2">and managing software can be very</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.880" end="01:34:26.239" style="s2">challenging because you need to keep up</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.800" end="01:34:28.880" style="s2">with the os updates or security patches</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.239" end="01:34:31.199" style="s2">or database backups or failure recovery</p>

<p begin="01:34:31.199" end="01:34:37.230" style="s2">with managing server software and this</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.400" end="01:34:38.480" style="s2">is when serverless comes in</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.230" end="01:34:41.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.480" end="01:34:44.480" style="s2">with serverless you don&#39;t upload a</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.440" end="01:34:46.800" style="s2">backend to a server with serverless you</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.480" end="01:34:49.520" style="s2">break your back-end into small little</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.800" end="01:34:52.480" style="s2">functions and you upload those functions</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.520" end="01:34:55.440" style="s2">to a server that you don&#39;t control on</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.480" end="01:34:57.440" style="s2">something for example like aws lambda</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.440" end="01:34:59.840" style="s2">and this is the big big difference about</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.440" end="01:35:02.400" style="s2">serverless and non-servers on</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.840" end="01:35:06.000" style="s2">non-serverless your server is always on</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.400" end="01:35:09.040" style="s2">24 7 ready to answer for requests</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.000" end="01:35:10.639" style="s2">on serverless the functions you upload</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.040" end="01:35:12.719" style="s2">are sleeping</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.639" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">and the moment that they get a request</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.719" end="01:35:18.080" style="s2">aws for example will wake the function</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.840" end="01:35:20.080" style="s2">up the function will wake up the</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.080" end="01:35:22.000" style="s2">function will do the job and then the</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.080" end="01:35:24.719" style="s2">function will go to sleep again</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.000" end="01:35:26.960" style="s2">and that is the revolutionary concept</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.719" end="01:35:29.920" style="s2">about serverless that it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.960" end="01:35:32.960" style="s2">be on 24 7 and that makes it really</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.920" end="01:35:35.679" style="s2">really cheap on traditional servers if</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.960" end="01:35:38.080" style="s2">for example you have 0 users or 100</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.679" end="01:35:41.040" style="s2">users you are still paying rent</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.080" end="01:35:43.679" style="s2">on serverless you only pay for an</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.040" end="01:35:45.520" style="s2">execution of your function this means</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.679" end="01:35:48.239" style="s2">that if you get a request and your</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.520" end="01:35:50.400" style="s2">function wakes up you start paying if</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.239" end="01:35:52.080" style="s2">the function finishes and the function</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.400" end="01:35:54.800" style="s2">goes to sleep again</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.080" end="01:35:57.600" style="s2">you stop paying and this makes it really</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.800" end="01:36:00.560" style="s2">really cheap for example the aws lambda</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.600" end="01:36:04.320" style="s2">prices are incredibly cheap you can get</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.560" end="01:36:05.840" style="s2">1 million executions for only 20 cents</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.320" end="01:36:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s insane</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.840" end="01:36:10.400" style="s2">this also allows you to scale</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.480" end="01:36:12.239" style="s2">better because that means that if you</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.400" end="01:36:15.199" style="s2">get a lot of users for example suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.239" end="01:36:17.520" style="s2">you have 1000 users what aws will do is</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.199" end="01:36:19.920" style="s2">that it will just wake up a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.520" end="01:36:22.000" style="s2">copies of the same function and once</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.920" end="01:36:23.920" style="s2">those users are gone those functions</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.000" end="01:36:26.159" style="s2">will go to sleep and you are not going</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.920" end="01:36:27.760" style="s2">to have to pay more and the performance</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.159" end="01:36:30.400" style="s2">of your website is not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.760" end="01:36:32.639" style="s2">affected because if you get more users</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.400" end="01:36:34.160" style="s2">you create more functions and it keeps</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.639" end="01:36:35.440" style="s2">going like that</p>

<p begin="01:36:35.440" end="01:36:40.560" style="s2">so what are the not so good parts about</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.320" end="01:36:43.520" style="s2">serverless and there are two in my</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.560" end="01:36:46.080" style="s2">opinion the first one is called cold</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.520" end="01:36:47.760" style="s2">starts like i said your functions are</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.080" end="01:36:49.040" style="s2">going to be asleep</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.760" end="01:36:51.360" style="s2">and that means that when you get a</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.040" end="01:36:53.360" style="s2">request there has to be some time a</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.360" end="01:36:56.320" style="s2">little bit of time that we&#39;re gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.360" end="01:36:58.639" style="s2">for the function to wake up and start</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.320" end="01:37:01.119" style="s2">working and this can take a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.639" end="01:37:03.679" style="s2">of time not so much but a little bit it</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.119" end="01:37:06.239" style="s2">will take longer than in a normal server</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.679" end="01:37:08.800" style="s2">because a normal server is always on and</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.239" end="01:37:10.800" style="s2">ready to go a serverless function is not</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.800" end="01:37:12.080" style="s2">on all the time it&#39;s asleep and it has</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.800" end="01:37:14.239" style="s2">to wake up</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.080" end="01:37:17.119" style="s2">to start working and that can take</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.239" end="01:37:18.800" style="s2">milliseconds it&#39;s not very very slow</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.119" end="01:37:21.199" style="s2">it&#39;s just milli milliseconds but some</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.800" end="01:37:23.440" style="s2">companies really care about milliseconds</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.199" end="01:37:26.960" style="s2">so maybe serverless wouldn&#39;t be a good</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.440" end="01:37:30.080" style="s2">fit for them having said that aws lambda</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.960" end="01:37:32.800" style="s2">for example has many ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.080" end="01:37:34.880" style="s2">which function is popular so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.800" end="01:37:37.440" style="s2">go to sleep completely and it keeps it a</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.880" end="01:37:39.920" style="s2">little bit ready to reply in case it</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.440" end="01:37:43.199" style="s2">gets more users so it isn&#39;t a big deal</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.920" end="01:37:45.520" style="s2">but it can still add some milliseconds</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.199" end="01:37:47.760" style="s2">to the time your server answers the</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.520" end="01:37:49.760" style="s2">number two thing not so good about</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.760" end="01:37:52.560" style="s2">serverless is that basically you are</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.760" end="01:37:55.679" style="s2">marrying your cloud provider if for</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.560" end="01:38:00.800" style="s2">example you deploy a serverless backend</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.679" end="01:38:00.800" style="s2">to aws you are basically marrying</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.840" end="01:38:06.320" style="s2">aws and if you have a fight with aws you</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.000" end="01:38:08.320" style="s2">cannot just take your functions and go</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.320" end="01:38:11.040" style="s2">to a different cloud provider because</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.320" end="01:38:13.520" style="s2">migrating from serverless provider to</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.040" end="01:38:14.560" style="s2">serverless providing it&#39;s not an easy</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.520" end="01:38:16.960" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.560" end="01:38:19.440" style="s2">is easier if you just rent a server</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.960" end="01:38:21.840" style="s2">space on aws and you want to go to a</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.440" end="01:38:24.639" style="s2">server space on google cloud but</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.840" end="01:38:26.480" style="s2">serverless wise the company has</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.639" end="01:38:29.040" style="s2">different ways of doing things so</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.480" end="01:38:30.800" style="s2">migrating will be a little bit more</p>

<p begin="01:38:30.800" end="01:38:34.800" style="s2">application will be changed when you</p>

<p begin="01:38:41.280" end="01:38:45.730" style="s2">figure out ways of doing that then is</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.600" end="01:38:47.040" style="s2">very very rewarding</p>
